            In India, where government jobs are highly coveted, cases of aspiring candidates resorting to unfair means are not uncommon.
            One way many job-seekers try to secure a place is by cheating in exams, which includes buying question papers or paying 
            someone else to write the test on their behalf.The bus in Udaipur was on its way to an examination centre and police 
            suspected that those leaking the paper were on it.At first, they waited at a distance as the bus circled around a building
             for a few minutes. Then they stopped it.
