<h1>History Of Java</h1>
<p class="c1">
  The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, 
  but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green 
  Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as 
  set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by
  Netscape. The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High
  Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling,
  who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.James Gosling -
  founder of java. Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions, etc. Following are
  given significant points that describe the history of Java.

<p class="c2">
  Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation
  dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),
  [17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] 
  Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
  computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
  The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available
  in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,
  [citation not found][19][20] particularly for clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
